Inspired by [Quicksilver](LCH_VITRINE_QUICKSILVER_URL), it lets you run commands via the keyboard.

You can run Launchlet as a bookmarklet, [browser extension](LCH_SHARED_EXTENSION_DOCS_URL), or as a module in your own project to add a 'jump to' functionality.

Read the [guide](LCHVitrineTokenGuideURL) to learn more.
