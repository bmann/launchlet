Launchlet is a simple way to add a name to snippets of code and then run it. Inspired by [Quicksilver](LCH_VITRINE_QUICKSILVER_URL), it functions primarily via mouseless interaction and lets you access your [Recipes](LCHVitrineTokenGuideURL) with a few keyboard strokes. You can also use it to personalize websites with custom CSS or JavaScript.

You can run Launchlet as a bookmarklet, [browser extension](LCH_SHARED_EXTENSION_DOCS_URL), or as a [module](LCH_SHARED_PACKAGE_DOCS_URL) in your own project to add a 'jump to' functionality.

The code is open-source and available on [GitHub](LCH_SHARED_GITHUB_URL).
